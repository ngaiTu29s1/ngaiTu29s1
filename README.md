### What I Do:

* **Automate:** Crafting intelligent scripts and systems to streamline processes.
* **Accelerate:** Developing efficient algorithms and real-time tools for performance.
* **Amplify:** Building scalable solutions that empower and enhance capabilities.

---

### My Playground:

* **Hardware & Embedded:** Deep dives into microprocessors (8086/8088) and hardware-software interaction.
* **Software & AI:** From robust C++ applications to smart automation (e.g., Anki systems) and AI/ML projects.
* **Full Spectrum:** Bridging the gap between offline-first architectures and demanding real-time signal processing.
