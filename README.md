# Tran Tuan Tu — Systems Architect | AI & Electronics Enthusiast

### 📍 Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam 🇻🇳

---

## I don’t just study systems — I build them, break them, and rebuild them better.

As a third-year Electronics & Telecommunications student at HUST, I'm driven by a passion for creating impactful technology. My journey involves thinking in circuits, coding in C++, and solving complex challenges with Artificial Intelligence.

---

### What I Do:

* **Automate:** Crafting intelligent scripts and systems to streamline processes.
* **Accelerate:** Developing efficient algorithms and real-time tools for performance.
* **Amplify:** Building scalable solutions that empower and enhance capabilities.

---

### My Playground:

* **Hardware & Embedded:** Deep dives into microprocessors (8086/8088) and hardware-software interaction.
* **Software & AI:** From robust C++ applications to smart automation (e.g., Anki systems) and AI/ML projects.
* **Full Spectrum:** Bridging the gap between offline-first architectures and demanding real-time signal processing.

### My Philosophy:

> Learning never ends. Tools are meant to be pushed. Big dreams start with clean code.
> My commitment to innovation means working late, dreaming loud, and learning non-stop.
